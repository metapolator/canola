# Canola

## extending a font into a font family

Canola (named Sean during development) is the first typeface family being produced with Metapolator's developer environment *RedPill*. 
On the following pages some techniques are described to work with *RedPill* and how to generate a font family from one master font. In the case of Canola, the master has been drawn as a *Hairline* style thus the shapes are very close to the skeleton. Some of the solutions are tail-ordered for this typeface specifically and some might be more generic.

##### Tool used in the process
- Metapolator
- Robofont
- Terminal (Command line OSX)
- Firefox

I'm evaluating the font from time to time in RedPill's web interface. Though due the long loading times I use Robofont to check Metapolator's output.

Once Metapolator installed we can initialize a new project in our local directory:

	metapolator init 'project-name'

from within the new project folder a master can be imported as *base.cps*:

	metapolator import ../mymaster.ufo base	
	
To verify the font has been imported successfully we can export our base:

	metapolator export base myfirstfont.ufo	

And we should get a copy of the original.
